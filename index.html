<h2> <br> MY 4 MAIN IDEAS </h2>
<h4> <br><br>1. Reduced food waste policies should be encouraged from the production stage until food <br> is eaten or performance is achieved this is so that whenever possible, the amount of wasted food is reduced</h4>
<h4> <br> <br> 2. The transport and warehousing facilities have to be improved as much as <br> possible to minimize any food wastage, and ensure that food reaches the correct people.</h4>
<h4> <br> <br>  3. Advancement of education and other resources needed by farmers seeking to understand new <br> ways of farming and the need to increase their focus on crops as well as the need for environmental conservation.</h4>
<h4> <br> <br> 4. Education for nutrition and health to improve food intake and <br> maintain the ideas of good health through a good diet</h4>
